SEO Goals
• Simple goal formula:
• Quantitative goal: x% growth of organic search tra c in y

• Qualitative goal: The tra c must be meaningful to our
business goal and at least %qualitative criterion%.

• Never start SEO with no explicit, measurable goal.

•

Everything else is Ballast!

Plattform

SEO Plattform

Ballast
• Pages that don't want to be found for anything (i.e. all pages except

Targeted Pages and the Startpage) are ballast from SEO point of view.

• Ballast should either not exist.
• "HTTP 404 File not Found" for non-existing pages
• "HTTP 410 Gone" for non-existent pages
• Or not be indexed.
• <meta name="robots" content="noindex">

Typical Ballast
• Error Pages -> HTTP 404
• Non-existent pages -> HTTP 404
• Search Pages -> noindex
• Pagination Pages -> noindex
• Navigation Pages -> noindex
• SEO Interlinking Pages -> noindex

• If only a small amount of ballast pages exist on the website, simply ignore them. The problem starts when the main
part of the pages on large websites are ballast pages and hinders the pages that you care about to get crawled and
indexed.

• But: Non-existing pages should always return HTTP 404 File not Found, otherwise you will spam yourself very
fast.

Edge Cases but not Ballast
• Imprint, Terms and Conditions, Contact are not Ballast Pages
• But "Branded Targeted Pages”
• You want to be found when someone searches for "%Brand% Imprint",
"%Brand% Contact", "%Brand% Terms & Conditions".

•

if we add x% more targeted-pages to our site, we gain y% more
traf c.

•

if we update x% of our pages, we gain z% more traffic.

•

if we make the user experience of our site better, our traf c gets
more sustainable.

•

if we gain more brand recognition, our traf c gets more
sustainable.

•

if other sites point x% more links to our targeted-pages, we gain
y% more traffic.

SEO process optimization is all about:

how do we create x% more targeted-pages with valuable,
unique content? (detail pages and list pages)

•

how do we add content/update x% of our targeted-pages?

•

how do we assure that our site gets better usage values?

how do we assure that our site gets more brand
recognition?

how do we get other sites to point x% more links to our
targeted-pages?

Think Mobile First

• in the future 70% to 80% of all your users will come via mobile devices
•

rst contact will be about 80% of the time mobile, even for b2b

Think bottom up!

• No prior context. Navigation does not matter. Think in targeted landing pages, how to inform the users,
solve their problems, where to lead them next from there. (Bottom Up Thinking)

• Do not think about Startpage or where users navigate from there. That is the opposite of SEO. (Top Down)

• f pages have - compared to the /b/ a pretty high bounce rate

• Brand, yeah starting (more than *blatt by now)
• But no strong brand + organic variation searches

plus))

• Ok-ish: between 14 and 30 days (good for big sites, for small site you have a

• H1 not biggest headline above fold

• why <meta name="robots" content="index, noimageindex">? is there a business reason? otherwise not use it!

• why do you have stu on deskopt that is not on mobile?

no SEO value at all #ballast - if you have an image it must be visible on mobiel and one side must be bigger

than 1200px (either srcset or link to bigger verison of itself)

• Image has no alt text
• subheadliens in listitems should be subheadlines? not DIVs
• mini optimizatin: link the headline + underline it per listitem, do not link the full list item!
• more extensive list item

editorial text is a dependency for future performance

• no FAQ rich snippets even though FAQ https://search.google.com/test/rich-results?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evi.gv.at%2Flp%2Fhauptversammlungen
